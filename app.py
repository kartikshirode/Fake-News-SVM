        Hey there! I'm your improved fake news detector! I've been retrained with better techniques to work much better on real-world news articles.
        
        **What's new in this version:**
        - Better text preprocessing that removes dataset-specific patterns
        - Improved feature extraction with regularization
        - More robust training with cross-validation
        - Should work MUCH better on real news articles!
        
        **How to use me:**
        1. Paste any news headline or article (at least a few sentences)
        2. Hit Submit and I'll analyze it for you
        3. I'll give you my verdict with a confidence score
        
        **New features:**
        - More nuanced confidence reporting
        - Better handling of edge cases
        - Improved accuracy on real-world data
        
        **Remember:** I'm much better now, but still not perfect! Always verify important news from multiple trusted sources. üõ°Ô∏è
