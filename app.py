        Hey there! I'm your friendly neighborhood fake news detector. I've been trained to spot suspicious news articles using some pretty cool machine learning magic.
        
        **How to use me:**
        1. Just paste any news headline or article in the box above
        2. Hit that Submit button and watch me work!
        3. I'll tell you if I think it's real or fake, plus how confident I am
        
        **Quick heads up:** I'm pretty good at this, but I'm not perfect! Always double-check important news from trusted sources. Think of me as your first line of defense against misinformation! üõ°Ô∏è
